      description: >-
        Transform static images into dynamic videos powered by Wan's advanced AI
        model


        ## Overview


        Generate dynamic videos from static images using the Wan 2.6 Image to
        Video model. The process consists of two steps: create a generation task
        and query task status and results.


        ## File Upload Requirements


        Before using this API, you need to upload your image files:


        ### Step 1: Upload Image


        Use the File Upload API to upload your source image.


        - [File Upload API](/file-upload-api/quickstart) - Learn how to upload
        images and get file URLs


        ### Step 2: Get File URL


        After upload, you'll receive a file URL that you can use in the
        `image_urls` parameter.


        :::warning[]

        - Supported formats: JPEG, PNG, WebP

        - Maximum file size: 10MB

        - Only one image URL is supported per request

        :::


        ## Query Task Status


        After submitting a task, use the unified query endpoint to check
        progress and retrieve results:

           Learn how to query task status and retrieve generation results
        </Card>


        ::: tip[]

        For production use, we recommend using the `callBackUrl` parameter to
        receive automatic notifications when generation completes, rather than
        polling the status endpoint.

                    Optional but recommended for production use.


                    - System will POST task status and results to this URL when
                    generation completes

                    - Callback includes generated content URLs and task
                    information

                    - Your callback endpoint should accept POST requests with
                    JSON payload containing results

                    - Alternatively, use the Get Task Details endpoint to poll
                    task status
