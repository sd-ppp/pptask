        Content generation using grok-imagine/image-to-image


        ## File Upload Requirements


        Before using the Image-to-Image API, you need to upload your reference
        image:


        <Steps>

        <Step title="Upload Reference Image">
          Use the File Upload API to upload your reference image.

          <Card title="File Upload API" icon="lucide-upload" href="/file-upload-api/quickstart">
            Learn how to upload images and get file URLs
          </Card>

          **Requirements:**
          - **File Type**: JPEG, PNG, or WebP format
          - **Max File Size**: 10MB per file
          - **Content**: Image you want to use as reference for generation
        </Step>


        <Step title="Get File URL">
          After upload, you'll receive a file URL that you can use in the `image_urls` parameter.
        </Step>

        </Steps>


        <Warning>

        - Supported formats: JPEG, PNG, WebP (Max: 10MB)

        - Maximum one image per request

        </Warning>


        ## Query Task Status


        After submitting a task, use the unified query endpoint to check
        progress and retrieve results:


        <Card title="Get Task Details" icon="lucide-search"
        href="/market/common/get-task-detail">
          Learn how to query task status and retrieve generation results
        </Card>


        ::: tip[]

        For production use, we recommend using the `callBackUrl` parameter to
        receive automatic notifications when generation completes, rather than
        polling the status endpoint.

                    Optional but recommended for production use.


                    - System will POST task status and results to this URL when
                    generation completes

                    - Callback includes generated content URLs and task
                    information

                    - Your callback endpoint should accept POST requests with
                    JSON payload containing results

                    - Alternatively, use the Get Task Details endpoint to poll
                    task status

                          bow of the ship. The male cat is an orange tabby
                          wearing a vest, standing behind a white long-haired
                          female cat in a lace dress, holding her paws as they
                          stretch forward in the wind. Both cats are
                          photorealistic with detailed fur, wind-swept hair, and
                          dramatic sunset lighting (warm golden highlights, cool
                          blue shadows). Background: the Titanic ship at dusk
                          with four smokestacks, glowing deck lights, calm
                          ocean, and orange-pink sunset sky. Center title:
