        ## Query Task Status


        After submitting a task, you can check the task progress and retrieve
        generation results via the unified query endpoint:


        <Card title="Get Task Details" icon="lucide-search"
        href="/market/common/get-task-detail">
          Learn how to query task status and obtain generation results
        </Card>


        ::: tip[]

        In production environments, it is recommended to use the `callBackUrl`
        parameter to receive automatic notifications upon generation completion,
        rather than polling the status endpoint.

                    - This endpoint must use the `kling-2.6/image-to-video`
                    model
                  examples:
                    - kling-2.6/image-to-video

                    task is completed. Optional configuration, recommended for
                    production environments.


                    - After the task is completed, the system will POST the task
                    status and results to this URL

                    - The callback content includes the generated resource URL
                    and task-related information

                    - Your callback endpoint needs to support receiving POST
                    requests with JSON payloads

                    - You can also choose to call the task details endpoint to
                    actively poll the task status
