        ## Query Task Status


        After submitting a task, use the unified query endpoint to check
        progress and retrieve results:

          Learn how to query task status and retrieve generation results
        </Card>


        ::: tip[]

        For production use, we recommend using the `callBackUrl` parameter to
        receive automatic notifications when generation completes, rather than
        polling the status endpoint.

                    - Must be `seedream/5-lite-text-to-image` for this endpoint

                    Optional but recommended for production use.


                    - System will POST task status and results to this URL when
                    generation completes

                    - Callback includes generated content URLs and task
                    information

                    - Your callback endpoint should accept POST requests with
                    JSON payload containing results

                    - Alternatively, use the Get Task Details endpoint to poll
                    task status
