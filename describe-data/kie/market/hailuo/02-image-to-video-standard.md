        ## Query Task Status


        After submitting a task, use the unified query endpoint to check
        progress and retrieve results:

        href="/market/common/get-task-detail">
          Learn how to query task status and retrieve generation results
        </Card>


        ::: tip[]

        For production use, we recommend using the `callBackUrl` parameter to
        receive automatic notifications when generation completes, rather than
        polling the status endpoint.

                    endpoint

                    Optional but recommended for production use.


                    - System will POST task status and results to this URL when
                    generation completes

                    - Callback includes generated content URLs and task
                    information

                    - Your callback endpoint should accept POST requests with
                    JSON payload containing results

                    - Alternatively, use the Get Task Details endpoint to poll
                    task status

                    - To ensure callback security, see [Webhook Verification
                    Guide](/common-api/webhook-verification) for signature

                          Epic aerial shot: A lone samurai stands atop a jagged
                          mountain peak as a storm of sakura petals is swept
                          across the wind. Behind him, the sky is split in two —
                          half daylight, half night. The shot pulls back to
                          reveal that the mountain is actually the curved back
                          of a sleeping dragon that spans across the horizon.
                          Lightning crackles in the distance as the dragon's eye
                          slowly opens, glowing with ancient magic. The samurai
                          doesn’t flinch; he lowers his straw hat and places his
                          hand on the hilt of his blade.
